 horstguides.0.t:0 "Basic Infantry"
 horstguides.0.d:0 "In Hearts of Iron 4 there are 2 commonly used infantry templates and three other less commonly used templates that every player should know. Which template you make depends on it's purpose. \n\nThe 14/4 - This is a 40 width (40w) infantry template with 14 infantry battalions and 4 artillery battalions. The purpose of this template is both offensive and defense. It has, providing one that has enough base soft attack or modifiers, enough punching power to be used on the offense to push enemy infantry divisions (usually 20w). This template is optimal for naval invasions when the infantry is swapped out for marines. This template also makes for good port garrisons in critical areas, like Gibraltar (use mountaineers), Malta, or D-Day ports.\n\nThe 20w - This is typically a 10 infantry battallion template. These are used exclusively because of their high organization, their low cost, and relatively good defensive stats. They are either used as cheap port garrisons or cheap frontline units to slow down enemy tanks.\n\nThe 7/2 - A rare template that is sometimes used in some port garrisons instead of 14/4s as they are more likely to reinforce into a battle.\n\nThe 40w infantry only - This template is the 20w magnified on a larger scale - they rarely have their defense value exceeded by the enemy attack value resulting in a difficult to push defensive unit. These work best with Mass Assault (R) roach builds as they have enough reinforce rate to easily enter battle from reserves. \n\nThe 11/6 - Like the 14/4, but a more glass cannon version of that, usually used on Marines to increase the number of 40w marines one can have (sometimes further increased by subbing 1 marine for an infantry battalion). \n\nCommon support companies : \nEngineers (must have), support AA (must have unless total air superiority), support artillery (good additional soft attack), recon (in 40w templates) and signals (in 40w templates). Logistics are sometimes used to lower supply use."

 horstguides.1.t:0 "AT Infantry"
 horstguides.1.d:0 "Anti-Tank Infantry is used to pierce (primarily German) medium tanks and attack their organization (de-org) using hard attack. They can come in 20w and 40w variants, with as little as 2 line anti-tank or as many as 10 line anti-tank in the template. They are used similarly to 20w and 40w infantry templates (no line artillery) except they are exclusively orientated around defending tiles against medium tanks.  AT infantry is best used in specialist mountaineer divisions (ie 11 mountaineers, 8 line anti-tank) as mountaineers have higher organization and overall stats when compared to regular infantry. An AT Mountaineer division can hold mountains, forests, and cities well against medium tanks without the need of tank support. They perform okay in hill tiles. It is not recommended to use AT infantry in plains or deserts, but they can be used well in such terrain with tank support.  As a rule of thumb, 2 line anti-tank of equal generation to the enemy tanks are sufficient to pierce enemy medium tanks. \n\nBeware: AT infantry can sometimes be countered by putting armor on medium tanks. Out of date anti-tank equipment or lacking sufficient numbers of anti-tank battalions raises the risk of this. "

 horstguides.2.t:0 "Special Forces"
 horstguides.2.d:0 "Special Forces are key to the flow of the game. Without Marines the Allies would have alot of trouble making any progress for D-Day, as would Japan in taking any of the Pacific. There are many kinds of Special Forces, all of which are explained below.\n\nMarines: Uses 14/4 or 11/6 templates (see Infantry Templates) for navally invading coastlines or (in niche circumstances) crossing large rivers more effectively. They can also be used to push Marshes, although this is not recommendeed. \n\nMountaineers: Similar to the above, but for defending or attacking mountainer tiles. Unfortunately these are not highly effective at pushing mountain tiles unless combined with very high base soft attack and/or modifiers. They are excellent for defending such tiles (like Northern Raj, in Burma, or in Gibraltar). They are also good in place infantry as a way to boost unit organization and other base stats (if combined with an advisor)\n\nParatroopers: Uses 20w or 40w templates (paratrooper only). This is used to snipe undefended airports, naval bases, victory points, and to assist in encirclements. These divisions are the only division in the game capable of completely blocking the enemies ability to reinforce. To block reinforcement, make sure you paradrop an enemy controlled tile and make sure your paratrooper does not reinforce into the battle, but your other divisions OR your allied divisions do. This is a little understood game feature that can assist in breaking tiles with high division counts or tiles which are too slow to assault (ie \"Stalin Line\"). \n\nAmtracks and Amphibious Tanks: \nCovered in Tank Variants and Equipment\n"

 horstguides.3.t:0 "Motorized Divisions"
 horstguides.3.d:0 "In general, motorized and mechanized based templates are weak in HoI IV. They use more supply than regular infantry, but aren't that much better. Any infantry template you could normally do can be translated into motorized or mechanized template. \n\nThe one exception to this that is okay is Motorized Rocket Artillery. Motorized Rocket Artillery has decent stats if you have an 8 mot/mech 8 mot. RA template. Combined with L/R Mobile Warfare, you have very good recovery rate and organization with decent base soft attack stats. L/R Superior Firepower is a valid alternative as well for mot. RA. \n\nTry to avoid motorized divisions unless you are doing a niche mot. RA build, which only works well with generic focus tree nations like Bulgaria or Ireland."

 horstguides.4.t:0 "Armor & Piercing"
 horstguides.4.d:0 "If you cannot pierce an enemy, they will still take damage, but only 50% of the damage you are outputting against them. Simultenously, they will have a 50% damage bonus against your organization stat. Piercing is, by far, the most important modifier when it comes to fighting armor. If you cannot pierce, you will have a very difficult time fighting enemy armor. This in particular is a problem for any current generation of medium tanks against another current generation of heavy tanks. If upgraded correctly with good templates a heavy tank division cannot be pierced by a medium tank division. In general, invest upgrades into armor if you are using heavy tanks (just enough to avoid being pierced), but be careful of over investing as every point of armor above the enemies piercing stat does nothing in a battle. Armor is not recommended on medium or light tanks, but they can be upgraded to fight niche anti-tank strategies (for medium tanks) and sometimes avoid being pierced by AA2 (for light tanks). "
 horstguides.4.a:0 "According to my degree in War Thunder..."

 horstguides.5.t:0 "Tank Templates"
 horstguides.5.d:0 "In a typical meta superior firepower tank division template, you should aim to either have 12/8 or 13/7 in terms of tank/motorized batallions. This is a good balance of HP, organization, defense, and attack stats. \n\nOne important consideration to make early on is to go with mechanized, or not to go with mechanized. Functionally, motorized and mech fulfill the same role, but mech will have superior HP, defense, breakthrough, and piercing. Mech is also more expensive. Because of the boost to stats it gives you compared to motorized, you can afford to dump 1 motorized/mechanized slot in favor of another tank without drastically hurting your defensive stats. Mech also raises the hardness of your division, resulting in greater resistance to soft attack damage. This is particularly useful when fighting infantry. The increase in hardness does mean you will take a greater proportion of hard attack damage, but because of the boosted defense it is offset. \n\nIf your tanks have a chance of being hit by CAS or fighting in contested/enemy air, then you must swap out 1 tank for 2 SPAA.\n\nIf you want to fight heavy tank with medium tanks, adding in medium tank destroyers or even heavy tank destroyers can help with piercing. Note that heavy tank destroyers will seriously lower the speed of the template, as it goes off the lowest speed in the template, not average. Tank destroyers are usually unnecessary for the Allies, Comintern, and GEACPS. They are primarily an Axis tech for dealing with Soviet heavy tanks.\n\nSPART should be included when fighting infantry only builds. "
 horstguides.5.a:0 "Light attack tank template?"

 horstguides.6.t:0 "SPAA, SPART, and TDs"
 horstguides.6.d:0 "Self-propelled anti-air (SPAA), self-propelled artillery (SPART), and Tank Destroyers (TDs) are the three basic tank variants in Hearts of Iron. \n\nSPAA: If there is a chance that the theatre you are fighting in will not have total air superiority, then your tank template must have 2 SPAA in the template. You do not need more than this. This is sufficient to reduce CAS damage down to a fraction of its potential and reduce some of the negative effects of "red air". This is a mandatory research for tank divisions. \n\nSPART: Like artillery, this is used to increase the soft attack of a tank division, which is the only stat it is strong in. It is not recommended to build SPART except when countering infantry heavy builds where high breakthrough is not needed, nor high hard attack. These have a hard time finding a place in any theatre of HoI IV except possibly against the British Raj, Japan, or infantry only Soviet builds. This can usually be ignored.\n\nTDs: What SPART does to infantry, TDs to do tanks. TDs will give a much greater boost to piercing and hard attack, making them effect at dealing with enemy tanks, but as a result will lower the overall soft attack of a tank. Soft attack is very important as there is usually infantry in the battle. TDs are recommended in circumstances where they might enable you to pierce an opponent. Many medium tank Germany builds will tech this to help deal with Soviet heavy tanks. "
 horstguides.6.a:0 "SPART only divisions for France?"

 horstguides.7.t:0 "Tank Upgrades"
 horstguides.7.d:0 "Armor: Upgrade only if you are using Heavy tanks against Medium tanks or medium tanks against AT Infantry only builds. Primary upgrade if needed.\n\nGun: Mandatory upgrade, you need to get this to level 5 ASAP (assuming armor is high enough for your needs). Primary upgrade normally. \n\nReliability: Good to upgrade to avoid losing tanks to combat attrition. Your tank should have minimum 80% reliability or you will take too many losses from attrition. Good secondary upgrade. \n\nEngine: Only as good as your lowest speed allows it, but speed lets you get overruns and exploit breakthroughs easily. It is a good secondary upgrade. \n\nAnti-Air: The "gun" equivalent of SPAA, this is nice to upgrade, but don't overly invest in it if you do. "

 horstguides.8.t:0 "Naval Invasions"
 horstguides.8.d:0 "Although some players think they know how to naval invade, there is often more finesse to this then is obvious. The optimal method of seizing a port is  to navally invade both the port and adjacent tiles with marines (or with 14/4 infantry on empty adjacent tiles), encircle the port (may requiring seizing 1-3 more tiles), and then force attacking it from all directions. An alternative method, which is recommended for ports which have no adjacent tiles (Malta/Gibralta), is to cycle in 2 marines at a time to invade a port. Make sure you launch your next invasion as the last one is finishing. \n\nIf you need to cycle attacks, but lack enough, then naval invade with 20w infantry divisions in the meantime in order to keep the enemy from regaining organization. Then, when your marines are ready again, relaunch your naval invasion.\n\nYou can also combine this with paradrops to deny reinforcement AND to increase your combat width on the invasion"
 horstguides.8.a:0 "Why doesn't Germany build marines?"

 horstguides.9.t:0 "Amphibious Vehicles"
 horstguides.9.d:0 "What marines are to infantry, amtracks are to mechanized and amphibious tanks are to tanks. They are marine tanks, for all intents and purposes. These count as special forces and therefore count towards your cap. They also have all the terrain penalties associated with mechanized or light/medium tanks. In Horstorical, these are variants of mech/tank they are based on (and convertible). The strongest amphibious tank you can research has the same stats as Medium I tank. This means that it is easily countered by AT 1 or even AA 3. They will failure to pierce late game medium tanks even, only capable of piercing light tanks. However, if they are not pierced, they have all the benefits of armor. One does not need high breakthrough to deal with infantry, and the base soft attack of these divisions are sufficiently high to push infantry during naval invasions. Think of them as armored marines, (space marines) not as actual tanks. \n\nAmtracks, although intended to be used with amphibious tanks, can be divorced from them and used in medium 3 or heavy tank 3 templates. These tank templates serve a similar role to amphibious tanks, albeit with more terrain penalties, but when they land they are much more capable of dealing with enemy armor than amphibious (medium 1) tanks are.

Nice, but not great. \nAmphibious - Not particularly useful, but okay for a starting general trait. \nNaval Liaison - Doesn't actually do what it says it does. Avoid this trait.\n\nCommando - The out of supply bonus is too weak to really do much.\nSkirmisher - Niche ability that no one can effectively use except for very rare GBP Italy builds.\nParatroopers - Useful for paratroopers due to the supply grace bonus and Glider Planes ability.\nCamouflage Expert - Amazing for nullifying enemy CAS damage.

 horstguides.11.d:0 "There are 10 FM level traits in HoI IV, but only 7 of them are worth taking.\n\nLogistics Wizard: This trait can be amnazing in typically overstacked supply regions, like those in the Soviet Union. It is significantly better for Axis than Comintern however. Similarly, this trait can be good for Japan when invading the British Raj.\n\nThorough Planner: The extra 10% planning bonus is another 10% attack and breakthrough if planned for. Very good for when you use Staff Office Plan. \n\nUnyielding Defender: This 10% Defense buff also applies to Breakthrough.  It will improve the chance of countering (cancelling) some common attack tactics.\n\nOffensive Doctrine: This should be on every Allied general - it gives +1 attack (2.5%) always. Ironically, this is more of a general trait than a FM trait. \n\nDefensive Doctrine: +30% entrenchment bonus is excellent on FMs with alot of garrison divisions. \n\nOrganization First: Higher reinforce rate is always nice, as it is prevents inefficient reinforcement from happening.\n\nCharismatic: Great trait, it boosts the recovery rate of everything by 10%, resulting in less downtown for your divisions. \n\nBAD TRAITS\nAggressive Assaulter: Isn't as good as Unyielding Defender.\nFast Planner: 25% planning speed isnt enough for a trait slot.\nExpert Delegator: You do not need so many armies in one FM.

 horstguides.13.t:0 "How to Grind a General"
 horstguides.13.d:0 "If you are playing Axis/GEACPS or Soviets, then you should understand how general grind works. Generals in HoI IV learn general traits by engaging in combat. As a player, you can control this "grind" so it is optimized. Regardless of what you want for your general, you must follow the golden rule: Avoid or delay finishing a trait grind until you are almost finished ALL of your traits. Why? The more traits a general has learned, the slower the grind. Hence, it is optimal to not assign any traits or fully grind them until you are almost done your grind. It is ideal to be 1 xp away from finishing the grind. The second most important thing is winning battles - you get more exp from winning battles than anything else.\n\nWant to grind terrain traits? Just fight in that terrain and win. Simple as that.\n\nWant to grind X leader trait? Just make sure at least x% of your army is composed off that kind of division. You want Panzer Leader? Then you only need to make sure that at least 40% of your divisions in your army are using templates where 50% of the template or more has tanks assigned to it. Equipment does not matter - they can be underequipped. You can even grind Panzer Leader with infantry, so long as 40% of the divisions led by that general are "tank" divisions. The same sort of rule applies for Cavalary Leader and Infantry Leader (must be over 80% in this case).\n\nWant to grind organizer? Set up a battleplan (do not activate it) and right click things. \n\nWant to grind invader? Do naval invasions until you have it.\n\nWant to grind engineer? Attack over rivers or against forts (you can build forts and bait the AI to walk into them and then attack them). You can also defend forts.\n\nWant to grind Trickster? Attack a tile from any 2 directions. \n\nWant to grind Commando? Find somewhere really cold, really hot, or naval invade. \n\nGrinding is as simple as that."

 horstguides.14.d:0 "Abilities give powerful boons to your divisions when used. They are the cost of command power, and, in some cases, unit strength and national war support. You should not use abilities on entire armies unless necessary. It is recommended you use them on fewer divisions, if possible.\n\nForce Attack: The most obvious use of this is to prolong a naval invasion as your divisions will not lose organization and will have more strength. This is generally not recommended to be used on tanks, unless you are not pierced and in green air, which may be a safe time to use this ability. \n\nLast Stand: Used to prolong the defense of a tile against an enemy division. This is best used to prevent your line from being thoroughly broken or to stop a naval invasion. This is commonly used by France players to maintain their defensive line in France, Italy players to hold places like Sicily or Rhodes, and the Soviet Union in holding the Stalin Line long enough to reinforce tanks into the battle. \n\nStaff Office Plan: This is best used on tanks for faster planning bonus. It is cheap when used on a few divisions.\n\nMakeshift Bridges (requires Improvisation Expert): This is best used on tanks to decrease river crossing penalties. Only use this against large rivers, like the Nile river, Dacca Line, or Stalin rivers. "

Very niche. \n\nProbing Attack (Requires Skirmisher): Divisions can launch attacks without losing entrenchment, but have a penalty to attack. This is best used on AT Infantry in GBP, but the allied nations that would have access to AT 3 do not have access to Commando.

It is only used for motorized or tank divisions, but SF is simply better for tank divisions . There is a niche use of L/L MW as a tank doctrine for the British Raj, as the bottom left option offers recruitable population which the Raj is in desperate need of late game. L/R Mobile Warfare also offers very good unit organization and recovery rate for Motorized Rocket artillery divisions and is recommended for such divisions. \n\nSuperior Firepower (SF): This is the go-to doctrine for tanks and for infantry as it offers strong bonuses to soft attack for both (R/L for tanks, R/R for infantry) and hard attack (R/L only). L/R is only good for maximizing Motorized Rocket Artillery soft attack (I would recommend L/R MW instead). R/L can also be used well for AT Infantry.

On top of this it has strong bonuses to strategic bombing which are excellent for bomber heavy ACs.\n\nBattlefield support: This doctrine is inferior to the other two doctrines when it comes to fighter bonuses and should only be considered for Japan. Gives the biggest modifiers to air support bonuses, making it very powerful for Japan.  For non-AC nations, this is an excellent doctrine as the ground support bonuses from doctrine only apply to your divisions, not allied.\n\nOperation Integrity: Lags behind on SD on how fast you get the fighter bonuses, but ultimately it is equal to SD on fighters. This doctirne gives good bonuses for inteception, making it a good doctrine for the Axis if they except to be bombed heavily (hence requiring constant interception missions)"

 horstguides.33.d:0 "As Canada, your early game industry is very poor and incapable of producing much equipment. At the same time, you are expected to do up to 3 doctrines in preparation for WW2 AND rush plane 2 or 3 (depending on ruleset). Start off by training 1 division (increase it to 50w and keep training) and training 1 ship (delete your other destroyer). You will need the XP.  Research CAS or Tacticals in one slot, eelectronics + air doctrine (Strat. Destruction) in another slot, and land doctrine (Mass Assault) in another slot. When you have a fourth research slot start naval doctrine (Base Strike).\nFor early game focuses take Halifax Shipyards, Rowell-Sirois Commision, and then Army Modernization. Build a heavy cruiser (design a template for this) that costs 3010 production cost so you can have a pride of the fleet for earlier partial mobilization. Use your PP to pick up a Silent Workhorst and then a Military Theorist for faster land doctrine research.  Wait until you go partial mobilization before going Free Trade or picking up the Shadow Factories focus. Also pick up the research speed bonuses from Italian/German scientist decisions. If rushing 1944 planes, make sure that before you start Defense of Canada Regulations you have completed Fund Fairchild's Development. Later, when you can, pick National Steel Car over Send in the Zombies.\nAs you research land and naval doctrine, make sure you spend army and naval XP on increasing the research speed. Try to save 30 days on one slot (whenever it makes sense) for each army doctrine tech so you can rush it even faster. If done correctly, you can easily have completed your land doctrine by the start of the WW2, freeing you from having to take Commit to the War. You can then rush If Day for earlier industry, and later pick Commit to the War to catch up on manpower (very late-game)."

 horstguides.51.t:0 "How to Research"
 horstguides.51.d:0 "While research might seem as simple as assigning a slot to a tech, there are some things to keep in mind. Whatever your nation is or whatever your build is you need research doctrine for most or all of the game. Unless you know better, you really should start research on your doctrine (land for most nations, air for ACs) day 1 of the game. If you intend on researching 1943 tanks for 1941, 1944 planes for 1941, or 1940 tanks for 1939 then you need to research those day 1 as well. It takes a long time to research tanks/air ahead of time and it takes a very long time to finish a doctrine. Therefore, it is best to research them from 1936, even if you only have 2 research slots. \n\nResearch bonuses are best used on ahead of time technologies. Reducing a technology from 150 days to 80 isn't that great, but reducing a technology from 1000 days to 600 is quite noticeable. For example, Canada has 1 research bonus for tactical bombers or CAS. You should research 1940 CAS/Tactical bombers normally (no bonus) ASAP, and then use your bonus on the 1944 variant. As South Africa you should "hard research" (research without bonus) Heavy Tank 1 and Heavy Tank 2 until you have your armor bonus. Since you need Heavy Tank 2 to be ready in 1938 in order to have impact for el-Alamein, you need to use your one bonus on Heavy Tank 2.\n\nIn addition to the two slots you dedicated to doctrine and tanks/air/inf equipment, you should use your remaining research slots on industry techs, electronic techs, and techs to support whatever you are creating. \n\nAdvanced Trick: You can research any tech faster if you cancel the research, research a different tech, and then assign the original research to a research slot with 30 days of saved research time available. Note: You can only speed up any research by up to 30 days of saved research. Anything more will result in wasted research!"

 horstguides.52.d:0 "To maximize civ constrution make sure you do the following: Research construction techs (if it makes sense for your nation), spend PP to go Free Trade (for higher construction bonuses), speed PP on a Captain of Industry (if available), and pick focuses which boost civilian industry construction speed. \n\nIf you start building with over 15 civs, make sure the most constructed item in your queue is always at the top. This trick will slightly boost the rate at which you finish your next civilian factory. \n\nWhen should you build military factories? Build mills at least 2.5 years before you need to have your production ready for fighting your opponents. Fighting for Africa/France? Build mills starting from mid 1937. Fighting Japan? Build mills starting from late 1937. Fighting in Barbarossa/D-Day? Build mills starting mid 1938. You can adjust these dates as is appropriate for your build."
